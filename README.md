# Classification-with_Neural_Networks_using_Python
Classification is the task of categorizing the known classes based on their features. In most classification problems, machine learning algorithms will do the job, but while classifying a large dataset of images, you will need to use a neural network. If you have never trained a neural network and want to learn how neural networks work, you can learn everything about a neural network from here.

Now letâ€™s come back to classification with neural networks. In this section, I will take you through the task of image classification with neural network using Python. Here, I will be using the famous [MNIST fashion](https://gaganpreetkaurkalsi.netlify.app/) dataset, which contains 70,000 clothing fashion images. Here our task is to train an image classification model with neural networks.

I will start this task by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset:
